[Demo deployment](https://healware.herokuapp.com)

## Local Development

Because this app is made of two npm projects, there are two places to run `npm` commands:

1. **Node API server** at the root `./`
1. **React UI** in `react-ui/` directory.

### Run the API server

In a terminal:

```bash
# Initial setup
npm install

# Start the server
npm start
```

#### Install new npm packages for Node

```bash
npm install package-name --save
```


### Run the React UI

In a separate terminal from the API server, start the UI:

```bash
# Always change directory, first
cd react-ui/

# Initial setup
npm install

# Start the server
npm start
```

#### Install new npm packages for React UI

```bash
# Always change directory, first
cd react-ui/

npm install package-name --save
```
